Sure, here are some beginner to intermediate topics in Anime.js that you can start with:

1. **Targets**: Understanding what can be animated is the first step. Start with simple targets like CSS selectors, DOM nodes, JavaScript objects, and arrays.

2. **Properties**: Learn how to animate different properties like CSS properties, CSS transforms, object properties, DOM attributes, and SVG attributes.

3. **Property Parameters**: Understand the parameters that you can use to control your animations, such as duration, delay, end delay, easing, and round.

4. **Animation Parameters**: Learn about the parameters that control the animation itself, such as direction, loop, and autoplay.

5. **Values**: Understand how to specify the values for the properties you're animating. This includes unitless values, specific units, relative values, colors, and function-based values.

6. **Keyframes**: Learn how to use keyframes to create more complex animations.

7. **Staggering**: Staggering can be used to create a delay between the animations of individual elements. Learn about the basics of staggering and how to use it.

8. **Timeline**: The timeline is a powerful tool that allows you to sequence animations. Learn about the basics of the timeline and how to use it.

9. **Controls**: Understand how to control your animations using play, pause, restart, reverse, and seek.

10. **Callbacks & Promises**: Learn how to use callbacks and promises to execute code at specific points in your animation.

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. Try to create simple projects as you learn these topics. This will give you a better understanding of how different parts of Anime.js work together. Good luck with your learning journey!
