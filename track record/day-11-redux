three fundamentals of redux , store reducersand ?

The three fundamental concepts of Redux are **Actions**, **Reducers**, and the **Store**.

- **Actions**: Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Redux store. They are the only source of information for the store. Actions are plain JavaScript objects and must have a `type` property to indicate the type of action being performed.

- **Reducers**: Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. They are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state.

- **Store**: The Store is the object that brings actions and reducers together. It holds the application state; allows access to state via `getState()`, allows state to be updated via `dispatch(action)`, and registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`.

                                    Reducers Must Not Have Side Effects
                                    Do Not Put Non-Serializable Values in State or Actions
                                    Only One Redux Store Per App
                                    Priority B Rules: Strongly Recommended
                                    Use Redux Toolkit for Writing Redux Logic
                                    Use Immer for Writing Immutable Updates
                                    Structure Files as Feature Folders with Single-File Logic
                                    Put as Much Logic as Possible in Reducers
                                    Reducers Should Own the State Shape
                                    Name State Slices Based On the Stored Data
                                    Organize State Structure Based on Data Types, Not Components
                                    Treat Reducers as State Machines
                                    Normalize Complex Nested/Relational State
                                    Keep State Minimal and Derive Additional Values
                                    Model Actions as Events, Not Setters
                                    Write Meaningful Action Names
                                    Allow Many Reducers to Respond to the Same Action
                                    Avoid Dispatching Many Actions Sequentially
                                    Evaluate Where Each Piece of State Should Live
                                    Use the React-Redux Hooks API
                                    Connect More Components to Read Data from the Store
                                    Use the Object Shorthand Form of mapDispatch with connect
                                    Call useSelector Multiple Times in Function Components
                                    Use Static Typing
                                    Use the Redux DevTools Extension for Debugging
                                    Use Plain JavaScript Objects for State
                                    Priority C Rules: Recommended
                                    Write Action Types as domain/eventName
                                    Write Actions Using the Flux Standard Action Convention
                                    Use Action Creators
                                    Use RTK Query for Data Fetching
                                    Use Thunks and Listeners for Other Async Logic
                                    Move Complex Logic Outside Components
                                    Use Selector Functions to Read from Store State
                                    Name Selector Functions as selectThing
                                    Avoid Putting Form State In Redux
