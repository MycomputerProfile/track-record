libraries aare the buillding blocks of our ddesign they can be basic ui  elements like buttons or icons or more elaborate compositions like toolbars and menus , libraries are the collection of components and styles we can use libraties in figma to create share and use components across your files . 


design system 
you might have heard of a design sysem , design sysem  combines component libraries with standards and guidelines for implementing them in code ,
they are single source of truth for designers and developers that help to create consistency at scale , 
libraries available in figma community  - figma community - https://www.figma.com/community
we are going to use a wireeframe ui kit  

we could copy the components from this file and paste them into our wireframes , we are going to publish these components to a library instead to make them  availble to our team .
