Sure, here are some beginner to intermediate topics in Framer Motion that you can start with:

1. **Components**: Start with understanding the basic components like `motion`, `AnimatePresence`, and `LayoutGroup`. These components are used to create animations in your React application.

2. **Motion values**: Motion values are used to control the state of your animations. Start with `useMotionValueEvent`, `useMotionTemplate`, `useScroll`, `useSpring`, `useTime`, `useTransform`, `useVelocity`, and `useWillChange`.

3. **Hooks**: Framer Motion provides several hooks that you can use in your components. Start with `useAnimate`, `useAnimationFrame`, `useDragControls`, `useInView`, and `useReducedMotion`.

4. **Universal animations**: Learn about the universal animation functions provided by Framer Motion, like `animate`, `scroll`, `inView`, `transform`, `stagger`, and `frame`.

5. **Easing functions**: Easing functions control the rate of change of an animation. Understanding these will help you create more natural and pleasing animations.

6. **3D animations**: Once you're comfortable with 2D animations, you can start exploring 3D animations with `LayoutCamera`, `LayoutOrthographicCamera`, and `MotionCanvas`.

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. Try to create simple projects as you learn these topics. This will give you a better understanding of how different parts of Framer Motion work together. Good luck with your learning journey!
