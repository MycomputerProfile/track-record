how can i apply stripe in my next js project?

Sure, I can guide you on how to integrate Stripe into your Next.js project. Here are the steps:

1. **Setting Up a TypeScript Project with Next.js**: You can set up a TypeScript project with Next.js by executing `create-next-app` with npm or Yarn:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-typescript my-stripe-project && cd my-stripe-project
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-typescript my-stripe-project && cd my-stripe-project
```

2. **Managing API Keys with Next.js & Vercel**: At the root of your project add a `.env.local` file and provide the Stripe API keys from your Stripe Dashboard.

```bash
# Stripe keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_12345
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_12345
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix automatically exposes this variable to the browserÂ¹.

3. **Loading Stripe.js**: Due to PCI compliance requirements, the Stripe.js library has to be loaded from Stripe's servers. This creates a challenge when working with server-side rendered apps, as the window object is not available on the server. To help you manage this, Stripe provides a loading wrapper that allows you to import Stripe.js as an ES module:

```javascript
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';
const stripe = await loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!);
```

4. **Creating/Retrieving the Stripe instance**: To optimize your site's performance you can hold off instantiating Stripe until the first render of your checkout page. To make sure that you don't reinstate Stripe on every render, we recommend that you use the singleton pattern to create/retrieve the Stripe instance:

```javascript
// ./utils/get-stripejs.ts
import { Stripe, loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';

let stripePromise: Promise<Stripe | null>;

const getStripe = () => {
  if (!stripePromise) {
    stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!);
  }
  return stripePromise;
};

export default getStripe;
```
